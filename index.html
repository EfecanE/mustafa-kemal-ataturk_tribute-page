      <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Atatürk recalls the historical achievements of one of the great people of this century, his leadership that inspired the Turkish people, the foresighted understanding of the modern world, and his might and courage as a military leader... The birth of a free Turkey from a crumbling empire, the freedom and independence of a new Turkey. It is the work of Atatürk's Turkish people to proudly proclaim and protect it ever since. Undoubtedly, there is no example that shows the confidence of a mass in itself more successfully than the deep and wide reforms it has undertaken in Turkey."
          </p>
